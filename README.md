# Boost Converter Model
This Model of a DC/DC Boost converter is an approximation of a switching model.
You will find diferent implementations, such as Python, C, Matlab...

To execute the Python model in a Jupyiter notebook click: [Boost Converter Model Python](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17blXxhXYZGddtZxGlVVpSNVU4JS4_cxu?usp=sharing)

To execute the C model in an onlineGDB interpreter click: [Boost Converter Model C](https://onlinegdb.com/6iAW8Ta4o)

To execute the Matlab/Simulink model a license is necessary. By downloading the whole folder, you can check the report in *Boost_Converter.html*. The folder *Boost_Converter_files* has to be in the same path. Otherwise check the [Boost Converter Matlab Report](./Boost_Converter_Report.pdf)
